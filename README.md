# Database-Manager
The Database Manager App is a tool for creating and approval of DB Queries by Developers.
## Problem Statement
Developers have access to database where CRUD operations can be invoked. This manager helps in creating a approval and operation logging process before executing queries.

### Backend Server
The backend server is independent and based on java. Backend interacts with your DB connection.

### UI Client
The UI client runs on separate server and is based on angular. UI allows users to approve/reject queries in DB. Also, users can send SQL CRUD query directly from the UI and see the output after approval. A log is maintained for every user.
